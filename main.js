//### Tasks

//- Create a variable called `myFirstName`. Assign `myFirstName` a string value that represents your first name.
//- Create a variable called `myLastName`. Assign `myLastName` a string value that represents your last name.
//- Create a variable called `myFavoriteCeleb`. Assign `myFavoriteCeleb` a string value that represents your favorite Celebrity's name.
//- Create a variable called `mySentence`. Assign `mySentence` a string that includes the variables from the previous three tasks.
//- Create another variable called `myLuckyNum`. Assign `myLuckyNum` a number value that represents your lucky number!
//- Create another variable called `myAge`. Assign `myAge` a number value that represents your age!
//- Create another variable called `myHeight`. Assign `myHeight` a number value that represents your height in inches or centimeters!
//- Create another variable called `myFavoriteYear`. Assign `myFavoriteYear` a number value that represents your favorite year!

//### Tasks that use MATH

//- Create another variable called `mySum`. Set it equal to the result of five plus two thousand three hundred seventeen plus thirty-six. Calculate it in code!
//- Create another variable called `myProduct`. Set it equal to the result of two hundred thirty-two times forty-three divided by two plus four (the operations should be written in that order!). Calculate it in code!
//- Create another variable called `myHeightAndAge`. Set it equal to the sum of your age and height. Calculate it in code!
